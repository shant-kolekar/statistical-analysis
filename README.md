# Statistical Analysis of Zomato Dataset

This project utilizes statistical methods to analyze the Zomato dataset, which provides information on restaurants, including their ratings, location, cuisines, and cost for two people. 

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the dataset and investigate whether there is a significant difference between the average cost for two people of restaurants that offer delivery services versus those that offer dine-out services or any other services by conducting various statistical tests. The project also aims to predict restaurant ratings based on given attributes using regression models.

## Dataset Description

The Zomato dataset contains information on approximately 10,000 restaurants from 17 different cities in India. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Restaurant name
- Location
- Cuisines
- Restaurant type
- Average cost for two people
- Has table booking
- Has online delivery
- Aggregate rating
- Votes

## Statistical Techniques Utilized

The following statistical techniques are utilized for analysis in this project:

- Z-test
- t-test
- F-test
- Fisher information
- ANOVA analysis
- Chi-squared tests
- Categorical analysis of data
- Regression models

## Analysis Objectives

The primary objectives of the analysis are:

- To investigate whether there is a significant difference between the average cost, for two people, of restaurants that offer delivery services versus those that offer dine-out services or any other services by conducting various tests.
- To gain insights into the dataset and identify any patterns or trends in the data.
- To predict restaurant ratings based on given attributes using regression models.

## Results

The analysis of the Zomato dataset revealed that restaurants that offer delivery services tend to have a higher average cost for two people than restaurants that offer dine-out services or any other services.

## Conclusion

The statistical analysis of the Zomato dataset provides insights into the restaurant industry in India and can be used to inform decision-making processes for restaurant owners and policymakers. The results suggest that offering delivery services may be associated with higher costs for customers, and that certain attributes such as location and cuisine type may be more strongly associated with higher ratings than others. Further research is needed to confirm and expand upon these findings.
